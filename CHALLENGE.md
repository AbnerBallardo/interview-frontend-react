This web application uses the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) to get user data (name, last name, and email) and show it on the default page. It's a straightforward application, but it can be improved.

Challenges:
* The Random User API contains the user's phone number. Change the code to include in the default page also the phone number.
* Identify ways to change the code to improve its quality.

The results will be evaluated during the interview.
